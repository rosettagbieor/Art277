  <p>We’ve heard it all since the pandemic started — lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks don’t work, if you<br>
    already had <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/" class="a">COVID-19</a> you can’t get it again or that the vaccines approved for emergency use will change your<br>
    DNA or put a tracking device in your body.

  <p>It’s almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation. But despite all the<br>
    myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.
    <br>
    <br>
    Wonderful news, right?
    <br>
    <br>
    Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a new set of myths — they’re literally magnetic or they’re<br>
    going to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of<br>
    protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else.
    <br>
    <br>
    So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread COVID-19 to<br>
    others? Infectious disease specialist <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/" class="a">Lyssette Cardona</a>, MD, answers those questions and covers why<br>
    vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against COVID-19.
