      <h2 class="h2">“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19” </h2>

      <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be<br>
        feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard<br>
        down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Cardona explains.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best<br>
          protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%<br>
          protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being<br>
          exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,<br>
        including other vaccinated people?</h2>

        <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds<br>
            that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.
            <br>
            <br>
            “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may<br>
             not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data<br>
             and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”
